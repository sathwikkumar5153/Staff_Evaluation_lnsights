Employee Churn Analysis

This project revolves around an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of HR employee churn data. The primary objective is to identify and understand the factors influencing employee retention within the organization. By delving into various features such as satisfaction level, number of projects, last evaluation, and salary, we aim to uncover insights that can inform effective retention strategies and foster a better understanding of employee dynamics within the company.

Key Features

The project encompasses several key features to facilitate a comprehensive analysis:

Data Cleaning: We start by importing and cleaning a dataset comprising records of 14,999 employees. This step ensures the integrity and reliability of the data for subsequent analysis. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics are employed to gain insights into the distribution and key metrics of different features. This step aids in understanding the baseline characteristics of the dataset. Data Visualization: Visualizations play a crucial role in exploring relationships between employee churn and various factors. We utilize a range of visualizations, including count plots, distribution plots, and box plots, to uncover patterns and trends within the data. Correlation Analysis: By examining correlations between different features, we aim to identify potential predictors of employee churn. This analysis sheds light on the interrelationships between various factors and their impact on churn rates. Insights Generation: The ultimate goal of the analysis is to derive actionable insights that can guide decision-making. We identify critical factors influencing employee churn, such as low satisfaction levels, high project loads, lack of promotion, and low salary, thereby offering valuable insights for retention strategies. Technologies Used

The project is implemented using the following technologies:

Python: Programming language used for data analysis and manipulation. Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib: Python plotting library for creating visualizations. Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. NumPy: Library for numerical computations and array operations.
